## Project: Image Classifier using TensorFlow

### Project Overview
This project trains an image classifier to recognize different species of flowers using TensorFlow. This is something similar to a phone app that tells the name of the flower when our camera is looking at. In practice this code train this classifier, then export it for use in our application. The dataset used for this project was Oxford 102 flower.
